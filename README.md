1 arduino, 1 pi, 1 1/8th scale rock crawler

Node.js
Socket.io
I2C

Raspberry Pi running node.js connects to ESC using Servoblaster to drive to motors and
the arduino using I2C to control the steering servo. I use a dual relay board to power 
the external wifi web cam, and the steering system (arduino).
